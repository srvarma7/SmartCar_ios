# iCar

### iCar is a smart iOS application, connects to cloud to retrive the real-time data that is posted using Raspberry Pi. 
#### Multiple sensors are used to get temperature, light conditions, collision alerts, current driver info, driving speed, speed-limits, location, lock/unlock status, find directions to car's location and more.

**Note** - Link to the app is not provided. Since, itâ€™s an IoT project, to see all the features in action the Raspberry should be up and running with all the sensors connected to it. Please use the following examples as demo.

- **Home screen** 
  - Beautiful landing page
  - Displays car loaction status 
  - Lock/Unlock status
  - Car's moment status using animation
    - Animates when moving
    - Stays still when no moment is detected

- **Car details**
  - Alerts the user, when car moves too close to the vehicles infront of it
  - Get outside and inside temperature details
  - Get current speed and speed-limit in the current location
  - Watch the distance let to the front of the car, when too close the app notifies the user by playing sound.

- **Speed Alerts**
  - Displays car's current speed and speed-limit of the road
  - When car speed exceeds speed-limit, the app warns the user by flashing screen and plays sound
  - Up to date speed-limits are gathered from API service

- **Profile**
  - Get your driving score based on your driving style
    - sudden draking and acceleration decreases the score
    - Linear acceleration and braking increases the score 
  - By this fuel consumption and car's health can be improved
  - Compete with other drivers as a challenge
